Success requires careful planning to delay, though never truly avoid, your character's inevitable demise. Each player creates a Dwelver, an adventurer setting out on an Expedition into a dangerous dungeon. You begin with a simple character and minimal equipment.

This script makes it easy to quickly generate multiple characters, each with a random class, skill set, and ability loadout.
